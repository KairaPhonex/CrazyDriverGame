# Crazy Driver 🍕

A simple 2D top-down driving game where you deliver pizzas to the people. I made this to practice physics-based movement in Unity, so the car has some drift and momentum mechanics.

**A quick note:** There were some music which changes with your current pizza status. I had to remove the actual background music files from this repo due to copyright, but you can still check `AudioManager.cs` to see how the code works.

**Tech:** Unity & C#
